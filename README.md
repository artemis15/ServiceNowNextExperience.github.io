# üëã Welcome!

This site hosts the Knowledge 2024 labs created by the Agent and End User Experiences team at ServiceNow, along with the Build Along Month project featured on [You & I Builder Live](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3rNcyAiDYK2Bgzj4mRdtfxMpGkI5KXBJ).


## Build Along Month

For the month of August, You & I Builder Live will host ‚ÄúBuild Along Month!,‚Äù where developers will have the opportunity to follow along as Brad and Maria Gabriela build a ServiceNow application from scratch in UI Builder using  Agile methodology. 

 

Our goal in ‚ÄúBuild Along Month‚Äù is to help you: 

- Become more familiar with UI Builder 
- learn more about UX concepts 
- get real-life experience using Agile as you might in your job as a Developer or Administrator 
- prepare you for future job opportunities 


### Discussions
  We‚Äôre using Discussions as a place to collaborate, ask questions, make this Build Along Month project even better, and show off our progress. We hope that you use this Discussions area for:
  * Contributing helpful links or fleshing out the hints section of stories
  * Providing feedback on how existing stories could be improved
  * Creating new stories to really flesh out the app building experience for our learners
  * Asking questions when you get stuck
  * Showing us your finished apps (Post in the "Show and tell" category)

We'll have different tags for the different types of posts you can make on here, so please help us by using the appropriate one for your post. 

If you need further help, you can check out the `#you-and-i-build-along-month` channel over on [sndevs.com](https://sndevs.com)'s slack server.  Feel free to link to your github discussion post on there if you need eyes on your question sooner.
