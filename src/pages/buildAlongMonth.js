                        <p>If you are brand new to the ServiceNow platform and/or UI Builder, you will most likely have trouble using the stories below right away. We are making a few assumptions as we write this, and we expect you are familiar with: </p>

The tasks below will expect you to be familiar with the platform, but especially UI Builder. You can attempt the tasks using whichever tools you are most comfortable using, for example if you prefer App Engine Studio then go for it, but if you don't want to use AES you don't have to. </li>

                <CollapsibleSection title="What is a story?">
                    <div className={styles.storySection}>
                        <p>A "story," or “user story,” refers to a specific piece of work that needs to be completed to contribute to the overall functionality of an application. Stories are used within an Agile development framework, which is a method of software development that emphasizes incremental, iterative work sequences commonly known as sprints. </p>
                        <p>Think of a story as a clear and concise description of a feature or task from the perspective of the end user. It outlines who will use the feature (the persona), what they want to do, and why they want to do it (the goal or benefit). This is often structured in a simple template: "As a [persona], I want to [do something] so that [I can achieve some result]." </p>
                        <p>Each story also includes acceptance criteria, which are the specific requirements that must be met for the story to be considered complete. These criteria are essential as they guide developers to know when they have achieved the goals of the story. </p>
                        <p>In ServiceNow, stories are used to track the development of new applications, enhancements to existing applications, or other updates that need to be made to the ServiceNow instance. Working on stories allows developers to focus on small, manageable sections of work that contribute to larger projects, ensuring that each piece of the project is done to a certain standard and is delivering value to the users. </p>
                        <p>In the stories below, you will find information relaying what is expected for the story to be considered "Complete". It will only provide the bare minimum guidance you will need to fulfill these tasks; it is up to you to figure out how to execute them. Feel free to be as creative as you'd like. In a real-world job environment, you'd be expected to adhere to the stories very strictly, but for the purposes of this exercise you can do whatever you want with your application. You can approach the goal with whatever technology, philosophy, or product you might want to use, just make sure you have a working app at the end. </p>
